# ARTH110: Introduction to Western Art History: Pre-historic to High Gothic
---

In this course, we will study the history of Western art, beginning with the first objects created by prehistoric humans around 20,000 years ago and ending with the art and architecture of the High Gothic period in fourteenth-century Europe.  The information presented in this course will provide you with the tools to recognize important works of art and historical styles, as well as to understand the historical context and cultural developments of Western art history through the end of the medieval period.  Introductory readings paired with detailed lectures will provide you with a well-rounded sense of the history, art, and culture of the West up through the medieval period.

At the end of this course, you will be able to identify key works of art and artistic periods in Western history.  You will also be able to discuss the development of stylistic movements and relate those developments to important historical events.  Completion of this course will prepare you for ARTH111, which surveys the history of Western art beginning with the early Renaissance.

(Note: This course will make use of a series of lectures from Professor Heather C. McCune Bruhn at Pennsylvania State University.  You may notice that the Professor frequently refers to a class textbook; please disregard these references, as we will be using a packet of various web-based materials instead.)
